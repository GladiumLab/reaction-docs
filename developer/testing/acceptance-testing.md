# Acceptance Testing

## Overview

**What is Acceptance Testing or AT**
AT is a process of testing the application to verify functionality from a users perspective. Related functionality is group together and tested by following the steps of an AT script. AT scripts will outline the functionality to be tested, success criteria, testing steps and any test variants.

**Why is this important?**
AT gives us:
 * Insight to pain-points and issues related to any user-flows. 
 * Clear step to reproduce any issues discovered during AT.
 * A plan to test all user-flow variants.

## Getting Started
There are three key touch points within the AT process
 * Test setup
 * Testing
 * Issue reporting

**Test Setup**
Most AT scripts will have setup steps as a prerequisite to the actual test. All test should follow these setup steps before following the test setup steps of the AT script.
